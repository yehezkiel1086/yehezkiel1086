# Hey, I'm Yehezkiel

Backend Engineer (Go) focused on building reliable, scalable backend systems and cloud-native applications.

I specialize in designing APIs, distributed services, and production-ready systems using Go. I have hands-on experience deploying applications with Docker and CI/CD workflows, and integrating AI services into backend architectures.

Currently working on backend systems, cloud deployments, and AI-powered applications.
